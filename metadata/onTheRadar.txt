top things to work on:
-ability to rename books
-combine books into "series", or "collections", name the collections
    new database table to save books in collections
-change chunks to be 1 sentence instead of 3. allow the user to choose how many 
 sentences are seen at a time.

new database tables:
collections
    collectionID
    collectionType.  --book, flashcard, etc
    collectionName
    userID
    bookID/cardID
    orderNum
staticChunk  --pre loaded with html to load onto the DOM. statistics, html for flash cards
    staticID
    staticContent
    staticDescription
flashCards
    cardID
    userID
    cardName
    cardContent
    cardAnswer
friends
    friendID
    userID1
    userID2
    dateFriended
chunksSeenPerWeek
    id
    userID
    weekID
    chunksSeen

need a triggered procedure on mysql to run once a week to update chunksSeenPerWeek table from users/numChunksSeen - chunksSeenPerWeek(all records per user).
OR update php logic to update bot fields at the same time
