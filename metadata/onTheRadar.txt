top things to work on:

-ability to rename books
-combine books into "series", or "collections", name the collections
    new database table to save books in collections
-add a way for the user to know a book is being uploaded

update number of chunks seen per week
    need a triggered procedure on mysql to run once a week to update chunksSeenPerWeek table from users/numChunksSeen - chunksSeenPerWeek(all records per user).
    OR update php logic to update bot fields at the same time?


dyslexia functions:
    change number of words per chunk
    touch a word to add it to a vocabulary flash card to filter in later
    touch a word and it opens up a tooltip with the definition
    text to voice (settings option to auto read, or click a button to read as needed)
