    <h2>Book Chunks</h2>
    <p>
        This website is designed primarily as a book reader, with capabilities to break the book down
        to managable chunks so as not to overwhelm the reader. There are options designed to be friendly
        towards people with ADHD and Dyslexia. It is optimized to work on a mobile phone. It will work 
        a desktop computer, but the formatting will leave a lot of blank space.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        This site is not limited to books though, you can upload any .txt file that you need to read
        through. Which could include school assignments, letters, short stories, anything.

    <p>
        We are very much in beta testing right now. If you choose to help out with testing, please
        head over to the Development Notes page to see what is currently on the radar for being fixed.
        There is also a form for submitting ideas or bugs that you have found.
